# Yahoo-Random-Catchall-Generator

A browser-based yahoo catchall generator using randomly generated names.

This was my first automation script and I chose to use the Selenium library to complete this task. However, browser automation is very slow when compared to request-based automation so I will starting looking to work on some request based projects in the near future.
